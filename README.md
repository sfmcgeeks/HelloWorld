Hello World Project

<--- ABOUT ME -->
Hi, My name is Nathalie.  I am an avid learner and have always been a big believer in sharing knowledge.  I run SFMCGeeks.com.  I started it as a way to catalog information that was shared in #EmailGeeks slack channel.  I have also enjoyed breaking down dev concepts and teachin them via fun blog posts. I do not profess to be an expert, so if you see a mistake - tell me so I can fix it.
IF you have a question - ask.  If I don't know the answer, I am happy to help you figure it out.
